Hello World, 

I am Fancy Cyber, a security researcher interested in many things, some of which are reverse engineering, APTs, malware analysis and threat intelligence. 

This is my blog, which means everything here is too long for Twitter yet too short for a book, though not everything here is worth your while.

All the opinions expressed here are my own.

Enjoy your stay,

F.C.
